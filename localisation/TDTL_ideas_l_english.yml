 ENG_Nationalism:0 "Rising Nationalism"
 ENG_Nationalism_desc:0 "Nationalism is on the rise! Ever since before the break up of the United Kingdom, nationalistic sentiment has been rampant across the country. Even one of the most common passtimes, the tradition of football, is plagued with this disease to the point where thinly-veiled fascist marches occur under the banner of \"Football Associations\"! The English National Party has been on the worrying rise and overall feelings of strong patriotism, to the detrament of others, are spreading."
 ENG_Reclaimation:0 "Reclaimation"
 ENG_Reclaimation_desc:0 "\"Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?\" was a song from the 19th century surrounding the ideas of German nationalism, which had not yet existed as a unified state. England stands today in similar, albeit different, circumstances. Little less than a century ago saw the fall of the British Empire, and the past decade has seen a gradual event much more integral to the identity of English peoples occur: the collapse of the United Kingdom. It was a domino effect. Scotland had long wished for independence, and they achieved it a decade ago. Not long after saw the unification of Ireland after over a century of division, and even Wales, which had long been thought of as closer to England, saw their independence. England was reduced too... well... England. Despite this, many English still see themselves as British and wish to reunify with the former United Kingdom sovereign kingdoms."
